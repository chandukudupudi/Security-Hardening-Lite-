# ACL Design

## Table ACLs

Operation: read
Script checks:
- If agent/admin → allow
- Else allow only if current.u_owner == gs.getUserID()

Operation: write
- Agent/admin → full access
- User → only own records while status != Closed

Operation: delete
- Admin only

---

## Field ACL

Field: u_ssn_last4
Operation: read
Role required: admin

Prevents sensitive data leakage to HR agents or employees.
